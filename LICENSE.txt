The Billy font (currently located in public/fonts/billy.ttf) has its own non-free license included in its meta-data, which is as follows:

Billy is free for personal use. To use Billy commerically you must first donate to me. You can donate any amount you please - consider it a 'Pay what you want' situation! Email me to find out how to do this. Once the donation has gone throuhh, you are free to use Billy in your commerical projects. However, you must not recreate, redistribute, or bastardise Billy in any way - he's lovely just the way he is!

The meta-data also includes a license URL, which points to <https://www.behance.net/gallery/16190081/billy-typeface-(free)>, and perhaps clarifies the license a little.

All other files are licensed under the MIT license, which follows:
